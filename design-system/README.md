# KodNest Premium Build System

A calm, intentional design system for serious B2C product companies.

## Philosophy

Calm, Intentional, Coherent, Confident.

No gradients, no glassmorphism, no neon colors, no animation noise.

## Structure

- `tokens/` - Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
- `components/` - Reusable UI components
- `layouts/` - Page layout templates
- `styles/` - Global styles and utilities

## Usage

Import the design system tokens and components into your project to maintain visual consistency across all pages.
