# KodNest Premium Build System - Design Principles

## Philosophy

Calm, Intentional, Coherent, Confident.

This is not a student project. This is a serious B2C product company.

## What We Are Not

- Not flashy
- Not loud
- Not playful
- Not hackathon-style
- No gradients
- No glassmorphism
- No neon colors
- No animation noise

## Color System

Maximum 4 colors across entire system:

- Background: `#F7F6F3` (off-white)
- Primary text: `#111111`
- Accent: `#8B0000` (deep red)
- Success: `#2D5016` (muted green)
- Warning: `#8B6914` (muted amber)

## Typography

- Headings: Crimson Pro (serif), large, confident, generous spacing
- Body: Inter (sans-serif), 16–18px, line-height 1.6–1.8
- Max width for text blocks: 720px
- No decorative fonts, no random sizes

## Spacing System

Consistent scale only:

- 8px
- 16px
- 24px
- 40px
- 64px

Never use random spacing like 13px, 27px, etc. Whitespace is part of design.

## Global Layout Structure

Every page must follow:

```
[Top Bar]
↓
[Context Header]
↓
[Primary Workspace (70%) + Secondary Panel (30%)]
↓
[Proof Footer]
```

### Top Bar
- Left: Project name
- Center: Progress indicator (Step X / Y)
- Right: Status badge (Not Started / In Progress / Shipped)

### Context Header
- Large serif headline
- 1-line subtext
- Clear purpose
- No hype language

### Primary Workspace (70% width)
- Where the main product interaction happens
- Clean cards, predictable components, no crowding

### Secondary Panel (30% width)
- Step explanation (short)
- Copyable prompt box
- Action buttons: Copy, Build in Lovable, It Worked, Error, Add Screenshot
- Calm styling

### Proof Footer (persistent bottom section)
Checklist style:
- □ UI Built
- □ Logic Working
- □ Test Passed
- □ Deployed

Each checkbox requires user proof input.

## Component Rules

- Primary button = solid deep red
- Secondary button = outlined
- Same hover effect and border radius everywhere
- Inputs: clean borders, no heavy shadows, clear focus state
- Cards: subtle border, no drop shadows, balanced padding

## Interaction Rules

- Transitions: 150–200ms, ease-in-out
- No bounce, no parallax

## Error & Empty States

- Errors: explain what went wrong + how to fix, never blame user
- Empty states: provide next action, never feel dead

## Consistency

Everything must feel like one mind designed it. No visual drift.
